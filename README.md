# computational-sound-lab3

This project was made for COMS3430 - Computational Sound. Implemented with Web Audio API, this lab is an exercise in modeling sound. 
Part 1 is a babbling brook. Starting with brown noise, I utilized filters, AM synthesis, and spacialization techniques (delay) to create the bubbling noise. 
Part 2 is a field of crickets. Drawing from Farnell, Designing Sound, physical modeling techniques were used to create a cricket sound with Web Audio.
